# Calculus Labs
These are labs written in python (Jupyter notebooks) for single variable calculus. 

## Instructions for Use

These labs are intended to be as "low-entry" as possible. For that reason, I recommend using Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/. You can either upload the file directly (using a Google account) or link to this GitHub repository (without using a Google account).

### Upload Directly

You can clone this repositpory (or download and extract the `.zip` folder) to save it locally.

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Click `File` and then `Open Notebook`
3. In the top menu, click `Upload`, and then click `Browse...`
4. Find the file wherever you saved it, and upload the file.

### Link to GitHub

You can link directly to this GitHub repository by following these instructions:

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Click `File` and then `Open Notebook`
3. In the top menu, click `GitHub` and then post the following url in the search: `https://github.com/peterkeep/calculus-labs`
4. Select the lab from the list, making sure to select the correct course's lab
5. Save a copy to edit for yourself: `File` -> `Save a Copy to Drive`


## Google Colab Instructions

These notebooks are essentially broken up into two parts: blocks of written text, and blocks of python code.

To edit a block of text (to add answers to follow-up questions for instance), you can click on the block of text to select it, and then click the edit icon (the pencil) in the menu in the top right corner of the block.

To edit a block of code, you can double-click on the block of code.

To run the block of code, you can click the Play button on the left of the block of code:

or you can also use use `Ctrl-Enter` to run a block of code.

The output (if there is any) will be included below, as seen in the gif above.
